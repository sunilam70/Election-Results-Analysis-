# Election-Results-Analysis-
Using Python to analyse election results

Overview of Project

-Purpose

We helped Seth and Tom submit the election audit results to the election commission.
The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:

The voter turnout for each county
The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
The county with the highest turnout

We have written some additonal code in Python using VS Code to obtain the additional information requested.


- Analysis and Challenges

Voting took place in 3 counties - Arapahoe, Denver and Jefferson and there were 3 candidates running for election.
Denver had the highest turnout of voters

Details of the votes each cadidate got across the various counties is provided below.



Arapahoe	 24,801 (7 percent of total votes)

  Charles Casper Stockham	 8,302 
  Diana DeGette	                15,647 
  Raymon Anthony Doane	           852 

Denver	        306,055 (83 percent of total votes)

  Charles Casper Stockham	 57,188 
  Diana DeGette	                239,282 
  Raymon Anthony Doane	          9,585 

Jefferson	 38,855 (10 percent of total votes)
 
  Charles Casper Stockham	 19,723 
  Diana DeGette	                 17,963 
  Raymon Anthony Doane	          1,169 

Grand Total	 369,711 



- Results 

Diana DeGette swept the polls in Arapahoe and Denver, but lost in Jefferson. (Jefferson county was won by Charles)
She got 73 percent of all the votes across all counties.(Chalres got 11 percent and the rest 3 percent went to Raymon.)
She won the overall election by a land slide margin!

- Overall conclusion

Based on the audit, we did not come across any errors and did not identify any concerns with the election data.
We can conclude that the elections were run true and fair. 

Challenges encountered: Nothing specific to add.

- Election Audit Summary

By updating the county and candidate dictionary / list we can use this code for any election.
We can add / append / remove candidates and counties etc without too much effort.
If we get more information on the demographics of the voters, in the CSV file, we can come up with some more qualitative analsysis on that as well.
Analysis of advance, mail-in and election day voting data could also be incorporated if the information is provided in the CSV file.
